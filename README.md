# AKEwithBigdata

Here, the implementation of our proposed big data-based scheme is presented. 
In order to run the code, do as follows:

1.Install MIRACL (Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic Cryptographic Library) via MICRCL GitHub repo (e.g. Instruction for Linux)
2.Copy miracl.a，miracl.h，mirdef.h to the work path
3.Add necessary files into the code (e.g. #include "miracl.h")
